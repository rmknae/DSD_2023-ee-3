# âš¡ DSD 2023 â€“ Digital System Design Labs  

This repository contains **SystemVerilog design and verification files** for the **Digital System Design (DSD)** course. Each lab focuses on different aspects of FPGA-based design, including combinational and sequential circuits, verification, and hardware implementation.  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Environment  
- **SystemVerilog** â€“ RTL design & testbenches  
- **Vivado** â€“ Synthesis, implementation, and FPGA programming  
- **QuestaSim** â€“ Simulation and waveform analysis  
- **Draw.io** â€“ Circuit diagrams & design partitions  
- **Nexys A7 FPGA** â€“ Target hardware platform

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  

### ðŸ”¹ [Labno_2](./Labno_2)  
SystemVerilog design and verification files for **basic combinational circuit design**, including FPGA constraints and documentation.  

### ðŸ”¹ [Labno_3](./labno_3)  
Design and simulation of **MUX/DEMUX & combinational modules** with testbench and FPGA implementation.  

### ðŸ”¹ [Labno_4](./labno_4)  
Design of **combinational logic circuits using K-maps**. Includes RTL, testbench, and timing analysis.  

### ðŸ”¹ [Labno_5](./labno_5)  
**Seven-Segment Display Driver** using minimized Boolean logic derived from **K-maps**. Displays hexadecimal digits (0â€“F) with FPGA constraints.  

### ðŸ”¹ [Labno_7](./labno_7)  
**Sequential Circuit Design with Clock Manipulation**. Displays 8 characters simultaneously on seven-segment displays using time-multiplexing and clock divider logic.

## ðŸš€ General Workflow  
1. **Design** RTL using SystemVerilog  
2. **Apply FPGA constraints** (`.xdc`) for Nexys A7 board  
3. **Simulate** using QuestaSim testbench  
4. **Synthesize & Implement** in Vivado  
5. **Test on FPGA** hardware
