# ðŸ“Œ Lab_no_3  

SystemVerilog design and verification files for **Lab_no_3**, including RTL, testbenches, truth tables, and documentation.  

## ðŸ›  Tools  
- SystemVerilog  
- QuestaSim  
- Draw.io  

## ðŸ“‚ Structure  
- `rtl/` â†’ SystemVerilog RTL design files  
- `testbench/` â†’ Testbenches for simulation  
- `docs/` â†’ Truth tables, diagrams & notes  
- `simulation/` â†’ QuestaSim output waveforms  



## âœ… What I Did  
- Implemented the combinational circuit (Fig. 3.17) and verified its truth table  
- Corrected errors in the given Full Adder RTL and testbench codes  
- Wrote clean SystemVerilog code for both circuits  
- Designed corresponding testbenches to check all input combinations  
- Simulated both circuits in QuestaSim and confirmed correct results
